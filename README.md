# AI Algorithms Visualizer

The AI Algorithms Visualizer is a web application that provides a graphical representation of various artificial intelligence algorithms. It aims to help users understand how these algorithms work by visualizing their execution step by step.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization:** Users can interact with the visualizations and see how algorithms progress in real-time.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Supports various AI algorithms, including search algorithms, sorting algorithms, and pathfinding algorithms.
- **Customization Options:** Users can adjust parameters and inputs to see how algorithms behave under different conditions.
- **Educational Tool:** Designed to be a learning resource for students and enthusiasts interested in AI and algorithms.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Algorithms Supported

- **Search Algorithms:** Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), A* Search, Bidirectional Search (Bidirectional), Best-First Search (BestFS), Iterative Deepening Search (IDS), Depth-Limited Search (DLS), Alpha-Beta Pruning (AlphaBeta), Simulated Annealing (Annealing).


## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python
- **Libraries:** NetworkX, PyQt5, Matplotlib, etc.
